# FauxCo Job Application Form

This React application has a form with name, email, and password fields as well as dropdown selections for occupation and state. All fields are required with additional regex validation for email and a 12 character minimum for password. The form will show error messages and will not submit if the requirements are not met. Once all fields are filled out correctly, the submit button will take the user to a submission success message.
